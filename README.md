# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project is meant to create the back end project for the WTWR applicataion. This back end was possible due to creating a database where we store the data. We implemented controllers and routes in order to create, delete, like, and dislike clothing items. Additional to the clothing items, we are able to create new users and find existing users by their ID.
